# Grid-Navigation-Game

## Project Overview
This is a text-based game created in C++ where the player navigates a randomly generated grid filled with obstacles to reach the target destination. 

## Main Game Features
* **Procedural Maze Generation:** Each play session features a newly created grid with dynamically placed obstacles, offering fresh challenges.
* **Intuitive Player Control:** Navigating the map is straightforward with W/A/S/D inputs, complemented by robust checks for boundary and wall collisions.
* **Real-time Console Feedback:** The game actively updates the display to show the player's position and the maze layout, clearly indicating when the target is reached.
